# Shape-Classfication-System
Image classification

The purpose of this project is to design a system that can classify different types of images.
For this particular project, the images will be of shapes and specifically, a triangle, square, circle and star. After classifying the shapes, this project will also investigate the effects of different parameters on both the accuracy and execution time of the system. 
The parameters that will be investigated include the type of data, epoch.  
This will be investigated by testing them. The results obtained will be comprehensively discussed and conclusions will be drawn.
